| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Application Description (_4d_)** | Ack why is everything in a blockquote? That is incorrect use of this style. Otherwise, the intent and scope of the application comes out clearly, though briefly. | -3 | Overall deduction for inappropriate use of blockquote throughout the document; blockquote was used in the template to indicate instructions |
| **Web Service(s) Used (_4d_)** | Utility scope is clearly stated. |  |  |
| **Top-Level Design/Layout (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Clear description, straightforward design, sufficiently illustrated. Annotated screenshots are a great idea‚Äîhandwritten or otherwise! |  |  |
| **Usage Scenario 1 (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | The usage scenarios both convey that you have a concrete idea of what this interface is. Steps are clear and the detail is good. It would have been nice to also have illustrations in this section, but I can understand how this would take a lot of effort due to the hand-drawn wireframes.<br><br>Still, with some hybrid thinking you could have done something without taking too much time. After taking the top-level layout pictures, you could have then loaded those images into an image editor and annotated _those_ images with step-by-step notes following what is said in each scenario. This would increase the impact of the text in these sections. | -2 | There is a way to illustrate your scenarios using the captured top-level design images without requiring too much additional effort |
| **Usage Scenario 2 (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** |  |  |  |
| **Design Rationale (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Some instructions left over! This would have been easier to catch had you used blockquote correctly (i.e., left it for just the instructions).<br><br>Once we‚Äôre past those instructions, a generally sensible explanation for many design decisions ensues, with some clear attribution of these decisions to established guidelines or principles. Opening by identifying your consciously-decided-upon interaction style is a good move.<br><br>It would have been ideal though to identify where each of the principles came from. For example, in the numbered list which names a guideline/principle and states the element(s) that follow(s) this, a citation for that guideline/principle would have been good. After all, the leftover instructions do say ‚ÄúCite relevant references as needed.‚Äù They‚Äôre definitely needed here! | -2 | Guidelines/principles that are mentioned here should include those sources in the References section then formally cite them from the Design Rationale section |
| **Usability Metric Forecast (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Forecast generally corresponds to what I see in the design. One thing that would have been better is to clarify that the efficiency being referenced here is the _very system‚Äôs_ efficiency vs. a paper-based system. This efficiency might be viewed as a utility vs. usability interpretation, but in fact one can argue that paper-based invoicing is itself a user interface, and in that light, the electronic system presented here is indeed an arguably more efficient user interface than the paper system.<br><br>But you should have said that yourself in order to show that you realized this to begin with üôÇ | -2 | Some clarification needed in the use of the term ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù |
| **Writing** | Writing is mostly clear and fairly clean. The references are generally correctly-rendered but the DocuSign listing appears somewhat odd, with its attribution of ‚ÄúC‚Äù as the author. Further, these references should have been cited in the text, just as with any other formal academic writing. They are definitely referenced here and there.<br><br>Finally, there is insufficient paragraph breaking. Most sections consist of a single paragraph, and in some cases a _long_ one. Try to be more granular in your writing; this would have particularly helped the usage scenario sections. | -5 | Overly long paragraphs (-2); missing formal citations for references (-2); DocuSign reference needs tweaking (-1) |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 28 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | on time |  |  |
|  |  | **86** | **Total** |
